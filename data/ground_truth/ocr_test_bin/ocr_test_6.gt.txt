(4) Interpretation of Results-Interpreting Consequences of Data Gathered from Phase 2 and 3, Making an Informed Conclusion and Proposing Suggested Courses of Action.
In a 2004 case study performed by GSK, in association with North Carolina State University, a "cradle to gate" of API production was carried out. The study fully assessed every material on a particular production tree, analyzed energy uses in all steps, and included waste streams and transport energy in the considerations. Using GSK's own in-house metrics the impacts of API production were fully analyzed from when the raw materials entered production to leaving the gate (Note: The fate of these products downstream was not included.). The results of the study found that solvent use is accountable for 75% of total energy use in the API production, and that great benefits can be obtained by more efficient solvent disposal, recycling and optimization [39].
10. ADMET-Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity
ADME is one of the oldest acronyms adopted by medicinal chemists and is a broad description of a drugs lifecycle in the human body. The shortcomings with such a coverall are that once the drug is excreted its effects are no longer considered. A more recent appendage to ADME is "Toxicity" to the acronym. This highlights the importance of toxicity parameters as part of the drug development process, but is usually limited to effects within the body (i.e., not post-excretion). Enzymes can critically activate or deactivate a parent drug molecule into harmless metabolites or biologically active compounds, and it is the latter that are of concern. A drive to understand the toxicity of potential metabolites has emerged using in silico methods (QSAR etc.). In silico modeling and predictive modeling can be employed during the drug development phase, along with traditional screening assays, to determine to within an acceptable degree of confidence, a drugs biological activity profile. The only shortcomings are datasets available to base these predictive calculations. This will improve over time making in silico screening more attractive and thus a reliable resource to complement traditional screening methods [40]. Other parameters beyond toxicity of a drug candidate can also be predicted including physiochemical properties (Log P, critical micelle concentration etc.), and can be useful datapoints in determining a drug's behavior inside the body and once released into the environment [41,42]. Furthermore, forays to predict biodegradation have been made using software suites such as META [43], BIOWIN [44], CATABOL [45] and TOPKAT [46].
Computational screening methodologies are usually preliminary studies before Phase 0 or Pre-Phase I clinical trials. Being in a position to analyze a drugs performance without increasing dosage to critical levels is a powerful asset. The ideology behind Phase 0 trials is that a non therapeutic quantity of the pharmaceutically active compound is administered to a trial participant. The dose while non-therapeutic can still have a measurable pharmacological activity in the body. This sub therapeutic level allows for monitoring of ADMET properties of potential drug candidates with minimal risk to trial participants health [47,48]. The results from Phase 0 trials can then be fed back into the drug design program and allow for alterations to a drug candidate to be made as early as possible in a drugs development lifecycle. The benefits of early screening are both financial and environmental, as minimum risk to clinical trial participants occurs, and a wealth of information can be gathered regarding a drug molecules toxicity before phase I trials [49].

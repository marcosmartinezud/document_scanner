Interpretation of Results Interpreting Consequences of Data Gatheredfrom Phase 2 and 3
Making Informed Conclusion and Proposing Suggested Courses of Action.
In a 2004 case study performed by GSK_ in association with North Carolina State University;
"cradle to gate' of API production was carried out. The study fully assessed every material on
particular production tree; analyzed energy uses in all steps, and included waste streams and transport
energy in the considerations. Using GSK's own in-house metrics the impacts of API production were
fully analyzed from when the raw materials entered production to leaving the gate (Note: The fate of
these products downstream was not included:). The results of the study found that solvent use is
accountable for 75% of total energy use in the API production; and that great benefits can be obtained
by more efficient solvent disposal, recycling and optimization [39].
10. ADMET_Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity
ADME is one of the oldest acronyms adopted by medicinal chemists and is a broad description of a
drugs lifecycle in the human body. The shortcomings with such a coverall are that once the drug is
excreted its effects are no longer considered. A more recent appendage to ADME is "Toxicity" to thc
acronym This highlights the importance of toxicity parameters part of the drug development
process; but is usually limited to effects within the body (ie, not post-excretion) Enzymes can
critically activate or deactivate parent drug molecule into harmless metabolites or biologically active
compounds; and it is the latter that are of concern. drive to understand the toxicity of potential
metabolites has emerged using in silico methods (QSAR etc.). In silico modeling and predictive
modeling can be employed during the drug development phase; along with traditional screening
assays; t0 determine t0 within an acceptable degree of confidence drugs biological activity profile.
The only shortcomings are datasets available to base these predictive calculations. This will improve
over time making in silico screening more attractive and thus reliable resource to complement
traditional screening methods [40]. Other parameters beyond toxicity of a drug candidate can also be
predicted including physiochemical properties (Log P; critical micelle concentration etc:), and can be
useful datapoints determining drug's behavior inside the body and once rcleased into the
environment [41,42]. Furthermore; forays to predict biodegradation have bcen made using software
suites such as META [43]. BIOWIN [44], CATABOL [45] and TOPKAT [46].
Computational screening methodologies are usually preliminary studies before Phase
Pre-Phase clinical trials Being in position t0 analyze drugs performance without increasing
dosage to critical levels is a powerful asset. The ideology behind Phase 0 trials is that a non therapeutic
quantity of the pharmaceutically active compound is administered to a trial participant. The dose while
non-therapeutic can still have measurable pharmacological activity in the body. This sub therapeutic
level allows for monitoring of ADMET properties of potential drug candidates with minimal risk
trial participants health [47,48]. The results from Phase 0 trials can then be fed back into the drug
design program and allow for alterations to a drug candidate to be made as early as possible in a drugs
development lifecycle. The benefits of early screening arc both financial and environmental,
minimum risk clinical trial participants occurs, and wealth of information can be gathered
regarding a drug molecules toxicity before phase trials [49].

CHAPTER 6. FREQUENT ITEMSETS

second pass allows us to count all the candidates and find the exact col-
lection of frequent itemsets. This algorithm is especially appropriate in a
MapReduce setting.
Toivonen's Algorithm: This algorithm starts by Ginding frequent itemsets
in a sample, but with the threshold lowered there is little chance of
missing an itemset that is frequent in the whole_ Next, we examine tbe
entire file of baskets, counting not only the itemsets that are frequent in
the sample, but also, the negative border itemsets that have not been
found frequent, but all their immediate subsets are. If no member of the
negative border is found frequent in the whole; then the answer is exact.
But if a member of the negative border is found frequent, then the whole
process has to repeat with another sample.
Frequent Itemsets in Streams: If we use a decaying window with constant
c, then we can start counting an item whenever we see it in a basket We
start counting an itemset if we see it contained within the current basket,
and all its immediate proper subsets already are being counted. As the
window is decaying, we multiply all counts by 1 ~ c and eliminate tbose
that are less than 1/2.

Although we will discuss tbis in more detail towards tbe end of the course; it is important to
remember tbat when deriving anything usíng passwords, we should always use 2 randomly generated
salt. The recommended length of the salt is 64 bits, or even 128 bits if you want to be extra-safe.
The key derived from PBKDF2 will be a function of tbe provided password and tbe salt. If you
wish to derive the same key again in the future, such as wben you 're loading the keychain from
disk, you will need to store the salt in tbe clear.
The idea behind salting passwords is to prevent an offline dictionary attack, where an attacker
derives keys for commonly used passwords, and tries to see if tbey work for different users' keychains.
Salting slows tbe attackers down since they will have to do a separate dictionary attack for each
useI _ To make this even more diffcult, PBKDF2 is deliberately designed to be a slow function (it
should take about 0.5-1s per evaluation on your laptop) s0 as to rate limit an attacker trying to
brute force it

3 SubtleCrypto
3.1 Using SubtleCrypto
The SubtleCrypto API is exposed to you in password-nanager .js via 8 variable called subtle.
For example; to hash a message with SHA-256, you could write in code:
let msgHash await subtle.digest ("SHA-256" "CS 255 Rocks ! ") ;
We encourage you to check out the docs to find out how to use the algorithms required for tbis
project! You may generally use SHA-256 as a hash function when one is required.
3.2 Key Usages
Wben building a key using SubtleCrypto, you must specify the types of operations that the key
may be used for. When building a key, there will be & keyUsages parameter, which should be flled
with an array of strings specifying the different actions one might take with the key.
If the key will be used to generate other keys, it requires the "deriveKey" usage. For MACs; you
will need to give the key the "sign" and "verify" usages. For ciphers; you will use "encrypt" and
"decrypt It is generally good practice to only enable keys to be used for the purposes relevant
to your use casel
3.3 Importing Passwords into SubtleCrypto
Tbe subtle API generally deals with ArrayBuffers rather than Strings directly. The Node in-
plementation of subtle will automatically convert Strings specifed as input parameters into their
corresponding ArrayBuffer forms.
However, one extra step must be taken to convert the password into useable key material. The
snippet follows:
let rawKey await subtle.importKey("raw password , {name "PBKDF2"} , false , ["deriveKey"])
4Of course, this only goes s0 far , and so if you use a password manager , you should make sure that you choose a
long master password that is hard to brute force.

(4) Interpretation of Results-~Interpreting Consequences of Data Gathered from Phase 2 and 3_
Making Informed Conclusion 8nd Proposing Suggested Courses of Action.
In a 2004 case study performed by GSK, in association with North Carolina State University;
'cradle to gate" of API production carried out. The study fully assessed every material on
particular production tree, analyzed energy uses in all steps; and included waste streams and transport
energy in the considerations. Using GSK's own in-house metrics the impacts of API production were
fully analyzed from when the raw materials entered production t0 leaving the gate (Note: The fate of
these products downstream was not included.) The results of the study found that solvent use is
accountable for 75% of total energy use in the API production; and that great bcnefits can be obtained
by more eflicient solvent disposal, recycling and optimization [39]-
10. ADMETAbsorption, Distribution, Metaboltsm, Excretfon, Toxicity
ADME is one of the oldest acronyms adopted by medicinal chcmists and is a broad description of a
drugs lifecycle in the human body. The shortcomings With such a coverall are that once the drug
excreted its effects are no longer considercd A more rccent appendage t0 ADME is "Toxicity" to the
acronym _ This highlights the importance of taxicity parameters as part of the drug development
process, but is usually limíted to eflects within the body (ie , not post-excretion) Enzymes can
critically activate or deactivate parent drug molecule into harmless metabolites or biologically active
compounds, and it is the latter that are of concern. A drive t0 understand the toxicity of potential
metabolitcs has emcrged using in silico methods (QSAR etc;) In silico modeling and predictive
modeling can employed during the drug development phase, along with traditional screening
assays, t0 determine t0 within acceptable degrec of confidcnce; & drugs biological activity profile.
The only shortcomings are datasets available to base these predictive calculations. This will improve
over time making in silico screening more attractive and thus
traditional screening methods [40}. Other parameters beyond toxicity of a drug candidate can also be
predicted including physiochemical propenties (Log P, critical micelle concentration etc.), and can be
useful datapoints deternining drug's behavior insidc the body and once released into the
environment [41,42]. Furthenmnore, forays t0 predict biodegradation have been made using software
suites such as META [43J, BIOWIN [44], CATABOL [45] and TOPKAT [46}
Computational screening methodologies are usually preliminary studies before Phase
Pre-Phase clinical trials_ Being position t analyze a drugs perfonance without increasing
dosage to critical levels is a powerful asset. The ideology behind Phase 0 trials is that a non therapeutic
quantity of the pharmaceutically actíve compound is administered to a trial participant. The_ dose while
non-therapeutic can still have measurable pharmacological activity in the body. This sub therapeutic
level allows for monitoring of ADMET properties of potential drug candidates with minimal risk to
trial particípants health [47,48}. The results from Phase 0 trials can then be fed back into the drug
design program ad allow for alterations to a drug candidate to be made as early as possible in a drugs
development lifecycle. The benefits of early screening are both financial and environmentat,
minimum risk to clinical trial participants occurs, and wealth of information can be gathered
regarding a drug molecules toxicity before phase trials [49].
